# fast-dice
For TTRPG Gamemasters and Players. Roll dice quickly. Tension is fragile. Speed is of the essence.

Using the app: click anywhere on the page to reroll all values. Changinge the #Dice value will roll multiple dice. Changing Bonus value will add a bonus to the dice roll - this addition is done after multiple dice are rolled, if #Dice value is more than 1.

When multiple dice are rolled (#Dice value > 1), the values in a column aren't independant of each other. For now, the recommendation is to refresh the rolls by clicking and only take the top value.

 
Starting the app:

Since this project uses create-react-app, you can start the server in the same way you start other create-react-apps. A common way for most people to build and locally serve this on Mac is to run these commands from the fast-dice/fast-dice directory:

npm run build

cd build

npx serve
